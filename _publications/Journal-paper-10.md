A frequency-polarization sensitive metasurface antenna (FPSMA) that can generate low-correlated measurement modes both at different working frequencies and under different polarization statuses is proposed in this letter. The FPSMA is composed of a linearly polarized patch antenna as the excitation module and a frequency-polarization sensitive metasurface as the modulation module. The capacity of low-correlated measurement modes is enlarged significantly due to introducing the polarization domain. The polarization domain refers to the angle between the polarization direction of the patch antenna and the metasurface. Performances of the FPSMA, including the reflection coefficient, the radiation efficiency, and the correlation coefficients, are evaluated. A coincidence imaging experiment is also carried out using the FPSMA and the target image is reconstructed under different conditions. The working frequency of the FPSMA is from 32 to 36 GHz according to our research foundations. The design is verified by both simulated and measured results.
