In Microwave Radar Coincidence Imaging (MRCI), the imaging region is typically discretized into a fine grid. In other words, it assumes that the equivalent scatterers of the target are precisely located at the centers of these pre-discretized grids. However, this approach usually encounters the off-grid problem, which can significantly degrade the imaging performance. In this paper, to establish a criterion for grid quantization, the performance of the MRCI system related to the grid size and the distribution of imaging points is investigated. First, the discretization of the imaging scene is regarded as a random sampling problem, and the off-grid imaging model for MRCI is established. Then, the probability distribution function (PDF) of the imaging amplitude for a single point target is analyzed, and the mean first-order imaging error (MFE) for multiple point targets is derived based on the Basic Correlation Algorithm (BCA). Finally, the relationship between the grid quantization of the imaging area and the performance of the MRCI system is analyzed, providing a theoretical guidance for enhancing the performance of MRCI. The validity of the analyses is verified through simulation experiments.
