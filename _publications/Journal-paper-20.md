To obtain the range and azimuth information of the target in a frequency-diverse bunching metasurface antenna (FDBMA)-based microwave coincidence imaging (MCI) system, a range–azimuth decouple algorithm (RADA) is proposed in this letter. First, an FDBMA comprising a double-layer rectangular waveguide feeding structure, a randomly modulated metasurface, and a parabolic reflector is proposed. Various radiation patterns can be generated at 134 sampling frequency points from 22 GHz to 26 GHz with an interval of 30 MHz. Then, a three-step imaging method, namely, the RADA, is proposed to retrieve the range and azimuth information of the target sequentially. Finally, by applying the RADA in an FDBMA-based MCI, the superresolved target image is reconstructed. The proposed FDBMA and RADA are validated through full-wave simulations.
