In this paper, a 1-bit dynamic reflection meta-surface (DRM) is proposed to perform computational polari-metric imaging (CPI). The proposed DRM is composed of randomly distributed 1-bit dynamic cross-polarization converters (DCPCs) loaded with PIN diodes. A dual-polarized horn antenna (DPHA) is used as a transceiver to multiplex the proposed DRM. By altering the working states of the PIN diodes across the DRM aperture, low-correlated dual-polarized reflection patterns that can be used as measurement modes in a CPI system are firstly obtained. Then, the performance of these measurement modes are evaluated in terms of correlation coefficient and singular value analyses. Finally, a metallic bar is employed as a target to be imaged to verify the CPI capability. The imaging scene is encoded by the measurement modes, and the back-scattered data is captured by the DPHA, thereby enabling the implementation of microwave CPI. The proposed design is verified through full-wave simulations.
