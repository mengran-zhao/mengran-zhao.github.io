This paper presents a comprehensive study of a compact two-element meandered dipole array aimed at achieving super-realized gain. An optimization was performed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) implemented in MATLAB, targeting the maximization of the realized gain in the end-fire direction. Three excitation schemes were evaluated: the conventional optimization approach to achieve superdirectivity (signal magnitude and phase angle), phase-only optimization, and uniform excitation (characterized by equal amplitude and no phase shift). The results show that by carefully optimizing both the signal magnitudes and phase angles, the array could achieve a substantial improvement in realized gain. Phase-only optimization provided a competitive realized gain with only minor reductions compared to conventional optimization, suggesting that optimizing the signal phase alone can be an effective strategy for compact practical implementations.
