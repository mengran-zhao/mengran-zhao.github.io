A wideband frequency-polarization-diverse reflection aperture (WFPRA) for coincidence imaging is proposed in this letter. The reflection aperture is composed of polarization sensitive metamaterial cells with different resonant frequencies and different rotation directions. The cross-polarization information can also be used to generate test modes (uncorrelated spatial gain distributions) based on the cross-polarization conversion of the basic cell of the WFPRA. The number of uncorrelated test modes can be significantly increased compared with the traditional case based on only one statistical dimension of frequency. The WFPRA is designed, which is assisted by the optimization method. The linear frequency modulation signal is used to improve the quality of the test signal. Simulations and experiments validate the proposed aperture.
