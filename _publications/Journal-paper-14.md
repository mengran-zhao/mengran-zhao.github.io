Traditional multi-mode orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams suffer from low energy efficiency in detection since the divergence angle tends to increase with increasing order of the OAM mode. Thus, OAM beams with equal divergence angle are highly desirable. In this paper, a frequency-diverse multi-mode (FDMM) OAM modulator with approximately equal divergence angle is proposed. The modulator is composed of an OAM modulation metasurface and a spatial filter (SF) with narrow passband. Firstly, the OAM modulation metasurface is designed based on multiple ring-like regions with different radii in the metasurface aperture. Each mode of OAM beam is generated at a corresponding frequency point in one region. Thus, the metasurface aperture can generate different modes of OAM beams at different frequencies (i.e., FDMM OAM beams) simultaneously. Then, the SF with narrow passband is proposed through synthesizing multi-layer frequency selective metasurfaces, aiming to reduce interferences between different modes of OAM beams. Finally, the FDMM OAM modulator is realized by superposing the SF on the OAM modulation metasurface. The FDMM OAM modulator can generate six modes of OAM beams (i.e., ±3, ±2 and ±1 modes) at 12.5 GHz, 13.0 GHz and 13.6 GHz, respectively. A multi-mode OAM coincidence imaging model based on the FDMM OAM modulator is established. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed FDMM OAM modulator can be used for target reconstruction and the coincidence imaging performance can be improved assisted by an optimization algorithm.
