The capability of the random radiation frequency diverse metasurface aperture (FrDMA) determines the performance of the FrDMA based coincidence imaging (FrDMACI) system. However, there is still no theoretical analysis result, though the FrDMACI has been experimentally validated. From the perspective of the spatial modulation, the capability of the FrDMA is analyzed assisted by the array synthesis and statistical theory in this paper. First, the equivalent mathematical model is built by regarding the metasurface element (ME) as a radiator with random phase modulation. The low correlated MEs are designed according to the requirement of the FrDMACI system. Then, the degrees of freedom (DOF) of the FrDMA are analyzed for both narrowband and wideband cases, respectively. In addition, the optimal design method of the FrDMA is proposed using the joint optimization of the mathematical optimization and electromagnetic simulation based on a set of MEs. The FrDMAs, including the optimal FrDMA and the random mapping designed FrDMAs, are designed, fabricated and tested. The simulation and measurement results show that the DOF of the FrDMA can be predicted when the aperture size is fixed. Finally, the performances of the FrDMA are validated by the super resolution coincidence imaging experiments. The imaging results show that the optimal FrDMA can approach the ideal state predicted by the proposed method.
